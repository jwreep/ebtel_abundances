# Modeling Time-Variable Elemental Abundances in Coronal Loop Simulations

A paper by Jeffrey Reep, John Unverferth, Will Barnes, and Sherry Chhabra describing a method to add time-variable elemental abundances due to chromospheric evaporation into coronal loop simulations.  An up-to-date preprint is available on the `main-pdf` branch of this repository.  

In order to compile this paper, 

(1) Install the ebtel++ code (https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/ebtelPlusPlus).  

(2) Build ebtel++ by running `scons` at the command line

(3) Define a system variable $EBTELPLUSPLUS_DIR to point to the local installation of ebtel++

(4) Install the `showyourwork` package (preferably in its own conda environment)

(5) From the main directory, type `showyourwork build`

This paper was produced with version 0.2 of ebtel++ (https://zenodo.org/records/12675386), and the data to produce the figures has been cached on Zenodo (https://sandbox.zenodo.org/records/80337).
